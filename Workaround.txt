Instance of Player = Player1 and Player2

Instance of Move = Rock - Scissors - Paper

Logic:
// -- // Game Starts > It shows player's names and it counts rounds
// -- // First Round > Both Players execute a move. 
// -- // Evaluating Winner > Function that check a conditional statement (if Rock is moved along with Scissor, Rock wins) - (if Scissor is moved /         along with Paper, Scissors win) - (if Paper is moved along with Rock, Scissors win), it starts over again until one of the Move is /         different from the other one (if Move is moved with sameMove, round will start again)
// -- // Display Winner = Shows winner and initialize the next rounds
// -- // Second Round > Both Players execute a move. 
/ -- // Evaluating Winner > Function that check a conditional statement (if Rock is moved along with Scissor, Rock wins) - (if Scissor is moved /         along with Paper, Scissors win) - (if Paper is moved along with Rock, Scissors win)
// -- // Display Winner = Shows winner and check for Endup of the game (if player has 2 consecutive victories, game will end, otherwise          /          initialize the next rounds)
